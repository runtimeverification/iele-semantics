IELE: Semantics of New Cryptocurrency VM in K
==============================================

In this repository we provide a model of IELE in K.

### Structure

The file [data.md](data.md) explains the basic data of IELE (including words and some datastructures over them).
This data is defined functionally.

[iele.md](iele.md) is the file containing the semantics of IELE.
This file contains the **configuration** (a map of the state), and a simple imperative execution machine which IELE lives on top of.
It deals with the semantics of opcodes, the gas cost of execution, and parsing/unparsing/assembling/disassembling.

### Testing

[ethereum.md](ethereum.md) loads test-files from the [Ethereum Test Set](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) and executes them, checking that the output is correct.
If the output is correct, the entire configuration is cleared.
If any check fails, the configuration retains the failed check at the top of the `<k>` cell.

[ethereum.md](ethereum.md) is also capable of executing tests of arbitrary IELE transactions (subject to the fact that this first release of IELE is still
built on top of an ethereum-like network layer). There are several differences in the syntax of the JSON test suite compared to the EVM test suite:

* Users can specify the function called and the arguments to the function in blockchain tests. These fields are not currently part of the signed portion of the transaction,
  for ease of compatibility with EVM tests. Transaction security will come in a future release.
* Users can ask for gas checks in the test to be disabled by adding a `"checkGas": false` entry to the top-level JSON object.
* VM tests call the function named `deposit`.
* Users can specify a filename instead of a hexadecimal string when specifying the code of a contract, and the code will be pulled by assembling the file, which contains
  IELE assembly. Filenames are relative to the directory containing the JSON file.
* Blockchain tests have only one possible schedule, `Albe`.
* Many fields that are checked by the Ethereum tests can be omitted or given arbitrary values, including:
    * `blockHeader` does not check any values aside from those which are input to the VM, and the remaining can be given arbitrary values.
    * `data` in a transaction can be an arbitrary value, but it still must match the signature of the transaction.
    * `genesisBlockHeader` and `rlp` can be omitted.

For example pure-IELE tests, see `tests/iele`.

Using the Definition
--------------------

### Installing

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

### Testing

To execute a VM test, run `./vmtest $file` where `$file` is a JSON file containing the specification of the test.
To execute a Blockchain test, run `./blockchaintest $file` where `$file` is a JSON file containing the specification of the test.

To execute all currently passing tests, run `make test`.

Contributing
------------

Any pull requests into this repository will not be reviewed until at least some conditions are met.
Here we'll accumulate the standards that this repository is held to.

Code style guidelines, while somewhat subjective, will still be inspected before going to review.
In general, read the rest of the definition for examples about how to style new K code; we collect a few common flubs here.

Writing tests and more contract proofs is **always** appreciated.
Tests can come in the form of proofs done over contracts too :).

### Hard - Every Commit

These are hard requirements (**must** be met before review), and they **must** be true for **every** commit in the PR.

-   The build products which we store in the repository (K definition files and proof specification files) must be up-to-date with the files they are generated from.
    We do our development directly in the Markdown files and build the definition files (`*.k`) from them using [pandoc-tangle](https://github.com/ehildenb/pandoc-tangle).
    Not everyone wants to install `pandoc-tangle` or `pandoc`, so the build products are kept in the repository for people who just want to experiment quickly.

-   If a new feature is introduced in the PR, and later a bug is fixed in the new feature, the bug fix must be squashed back into the feature introduction.
    The *only* exceptions to this are if you want to document the bug because it was quite tricky or is something you believe should be fixed about K.
    In these exceptional cases, place the bug-fix commit directly after the feature introduction commit and leave useful commit messages.
    In addition, mark the feature introduction commit with `[skip-ci]` if tests will fail on that commit so that we know not to waste time testing it.

-   No tab characters, 4 spaces instead.
    Linux-style line endings; if you're on a Windows machine make sure to run `dos2unix` on the files.

### Hard - PR Tip

These are hard requirements (**must** be met before review), but they only have to be true for the tip of the PR before review.

-   Every test in the repository must pass.
    We will test this with `./tests/ci/with-k bothk ./Build test-all` (or `./tests/ci/with-k bothk ./Build partest-all` on parallel machines).

### Soft - Every Commit

These are soft requirements (review **may** start without these being met), and they will be considered for **every** commit in the PR.

-   Comments do not live in the K code blocks, but rather in the surrounding Markdown (unless there is a really good reason to localize the comment).

-   You should consider prefixing "internal" symbols (symbols that a user would not write in a program) with a hash (`#`).

-   Place a line of `-` after each block of syntax declarations.

    ```{.k}
        syntax Foo ::= "newSymbol"
     // --------------------------
        rule <k> newSymbol => . ... </k>
    ```

    Notice that if there are rules immediately following the syntax declaration, a commented-out line of `-` is inserted afterward.
    Notice that the width of the line of `-` matches that of the preceding line.

-   Place spaces around parentheses and commas in K's pretty functional-style syntax declarations.

    ```{.k}
        syntax Foo ::= newFunctionalSyntax ( Int , String )
     // ---------------------------------------------------
    ```

-   When multiple structurally-similar rules are present, line up as much as possible (and makes sense).

    ```{.k}
        rule <k> #do1       => . ... </k> <cell1> not-done => done        </cell1>
        rule <k> #do1Longer => . ... </k> <cell1> not-done => done-longer </cell1>

        rule <k> #do2     => . ... </k> <cell2> not-done => done2 </cell2>
        rule <k> #doShort => . ... </k> <cell2> nd       => done2 </cell2>
    ```

    This makes it simpler to make changes to entire groups of rules at a time using sufficiently modern editors.
    Notice that if we break alignment (eg. from the `#do1` group above to the `#do2` group), we put an extra line between the groups of rules.

-   Line up the `r` in `requires` with the `l` in `rule` (if it's not all on one line).
    Similarly, line up the end of `andBool` for extra side-conditions with the end of `requires`.

    ```{.k}
        rule <k> A => B ... </k>
             SOME_LARGE_CONFIGURATION

          requires A > 3
           andBool isPrime(A)
    ```
